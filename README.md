**In the Jetreview, At the moment I can't authenticate the guest properly in the reviews, even though I have the contact in the crm. We will come back to it later.**


### Actions

A new action has now been added. It is called **Update posts**. This is an independent action. You have the possibility to select one of several post types (cpt) and to which status the automation should change it. You can choose to apply to all posts or to all posts except the last one.
